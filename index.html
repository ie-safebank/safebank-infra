            <h2>The 5 Implemented OpenSSF Frameworks</h2>
            <p>The OpenSSF framework ‘Concise Guide for Developing More Secure Software’ is a list of 27 guidelines aimed at reducing vulnerabilities attackers could exploit. This section describes the security guidelines implemented in Safe-Bank.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Multi Factor Authentication</h3>
                    <p>MFA adds an additional security layer to Github accounts, reducing risks of unauthorized access. The Cybersecurity engineer activated the “Requirement to have MFA” to ensure organizational security.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Monitor Dependency Vulnerabilities</h3>
                    <p>IE-Safebank uses Dependabot in Github to scan for vulnerabilities categorized as low, medium, high, or critical. Medium and low risks were deprioritized due to time constraints.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Keep Dependencies Reasonably Up-to-Date</h3>
                    <p>To address human-centric aspects of Dependabot, alerts were connected to a Slack channel to notify developers promptly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Do Not Push Secrets to a Repository</h3>
                    <p>Using Github’s ‘Secret Scanning’ tool, commits are automatically scanned for hard-coded secrets, reducing vulnerabilities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Review Code Changes</h3>
                    <p>IE-Safebank enforces code reviews before merging pull requests. This practice enhances main branch security and fosters knowledge sharing among team members.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <section>
            <h2>Learning Secure Software Development Practices</h2>
            <p>IE-Safebank prioritizes secure development. The Cybersecurity engineer completed the Linux Foundation’s hands-on course with top scores to ensure robust practices.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The 5 Implemented SAFEcode Frameworks</h2>
            <p>Similar to OpenSSF, the “Fundamental Practices for Secure Software Development” emphasizes reducing vulnerabilities through 19 critical practices. This section highlights the implementations at IE-Safebank.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Manage Security Findings</h3>
                    <p>IE-Safebank implemented the OpenSSF scorecard tool to assess software security heuristics, scoring each from 0-10. This guided improvements in weak areas, ensuring customer safety.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Secure Coding Practices</h3>
                    <p>Details to be included.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Testing and Validation</h3>
                    <p>Details to be included.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Planning the Implementation and Deployment of Secure Development Practices</h3>
